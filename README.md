## About

**Main Hub** is a Web Application I built as my second resume project. My main goal was to develop a **Full-Stack App** that has:

- **Backend side** to handle API requests (e.g., Authentication, Weather).
- **Frontend side** to handle the app itself.

**The Technologies for this Application are:**

- **Backend:** Express.js, axios, Spotify-Web-API-Node
- **Frontend:** React (Vite), Redux Toolkit, Firebase, Firestore, axios, Tailwind CSS, Spotify-Web-API-JS, Framer Motion, React Router DOM
- The app is fully typed with **Typescript** and documented with **JSDocs**.

## Idea

The idea for the project was to make a Hub Application that includes the following features:

- Full User Supports
- User Preferences (Themes, Weather location, Spotify account link)
- Weather - Current weather and Forecast.
- Spotify Support (with Player)
- Maps & Space App (NASA API) - unfortunately, I didn't implement them (maybe in the future ðŸ¤ž)

I also wanted to combine two projects I worked on in the past inside this project (music-player, weather-app).

On that note, let's move to the Process.
