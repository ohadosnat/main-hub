## **Overall & Design System**

The main design guideline for this project was my [Car Music Interface](https://ohadosnat.github.io/tailwind-collection/pages/car-music.html) from the [Tailwind Collection](https://github.com/ohadosnat/tailwind-collection) project I did a while back.

The design of **Car Music Interface** matches what I wanted, a Hub that can include all sorts of functionalities.

In future sections, I'll cover what I took from there.

## **Music Player**

The overall design is the same, but since I wanted to add Spotify support with all sorts of functionalities, I had to change the design.

## **Home & Settings**

My goal was to make these pages simple, clean, and similar to popular designs (e.g., smartphones, car dashboard interfaces).

## **Weather**

I implemented the design from my "weather-app" project. I had to make a few changes for it to fit this project's design.

## **Upcoming Features**

### **Space App**

The idea was to use NASA's Astronomy Picture of the Day API to educate the user about Space.

- Each day, a new Astronomy picture.
- Users can favorite images, look through the archive

### **Navigation**

The idea was simple, add Google Maps API to this page and have a map that the user can use to search places and get directions.

But I didn't have the chance to work on this feature.
